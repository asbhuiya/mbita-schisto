This file includes 30 observations and 5 variables. 

Each observation corresponds to a single village (vid). This file includes spatially joined measurements from remotely sensed datasets. Spatial data were joined using village centroids. The lon/lat coordinates of the villages are not included in this file to protect confidentiality. 

This file was created with this notebook, which extracts most of the layers using 
R's raster package:
https://github.com/ben-arnold/mbita-schisto/blob/master/R/Fig1-FigS1-FigS5-mbita-schisto-map.Rmd

The global surface water layer was accessed through Google EE using this script:

https://github.com/ben-arnold/mbita-schisto/blob/master/R/mbita-schisto-gsw-google-ee.js

Neither script can be run without the lon/lat coordinates of the villages.
If you need village lon/lat coordinates, please contact Ben Arnold at UCSF (ben.arnold@ucsf.edu). Sharing that information will probably require IRB coverage and a data sharing agreement.
