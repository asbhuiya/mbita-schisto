# mbita-schisto/R/ subdirectory README

This directory includes computational notebooks that completed all analyses in the article entitled _Fine-scale heterogeneity in Schistosoma mansoni force of infection measured through antibody response_. 

The R script `mbita-schisto-run-all.R` runs the notebooks in order and will re-create the entire analysis. Before running the notbooks, you will need to create a directory entitled `output` one level up, alongside the `R` directory, to store saved results (not pushed to GitHub).
