Fine-scale heterogeneity in Schistosoma mansoni force of infection measured through serologic surveillance


## Description

This repository includes data and replication files to reproduce the analyses in the manuscript entitled _Fine-scale heterogeneity in Schistosoma mansoni force of infection measured through serologic surveillance_

The materials in this repo are cross-linked with the Open Science Framework repository: https://osf.io/rnme8/

Each dataset includes a codebook. We have not included lon/lat village coordinates under guidance from our IRB, so the notebook that creates Figure 1, Supplementary Figure 1, and Supplementary Figure 5 cannot be run on the publicly available data (though the source code and HTML output are in the repo)

If you have any questions about these files, please contact Ben Arnold at UCSF (ben.arnold@ucsf.edu).
